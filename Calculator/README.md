# Calculator-in-Shell
Implemented a calculator using Linux shell script, with the following four operators:
1 - Add (a)
2 - Subtract (s)
3 - Multiply (m)
4 - Divide (d)

Only two operands and one operator will be allowed. Each operand can only be a number between 1-100. The data is first verified to be within the range and valid, meaning no alphabets or any other character is given as input.
